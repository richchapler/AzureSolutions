There are many, many options for visualizing and analyzing geo-spatial data. This documentation details step-by-step instructions for some of these options.

| Option | Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Power BI, Shape Map** | - | - |

_Note: This list of Pros and Cons is based on my research, experience and perception ONLY. Your answer to "why use Option X?" may be as simple as the fact that you favor that option._

The location field
The Location field in the Azure Maps Power BI Visual can accept multiple values, such as country, region, state, city, street address and zip code. By providing multiple sources of location information in the Location field, you help to guarantee more accurate results and eliminate ambiguity that would prevent a specific location to be determined. For example, there are over 20 different cities in the United States named Franklin.
