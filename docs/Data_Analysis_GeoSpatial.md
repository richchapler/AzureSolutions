The location field
The Location field in the Azure Maps Power BI Visual can accept multiple values, such as country, region, state, city, street address and zip code. By providing multiple sources of location information in the Location field, you help to guarantee more accurate results and eliminate ambiguity that would prevent a specific location to be determined. For example, there are over 20 different cities in the United States named Franklin.
