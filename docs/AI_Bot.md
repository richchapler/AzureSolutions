## Use Case
* "We want to surface our OpenAI solution as a bot in various channels (Teams, Alexa, Facebook, etc.)

## Solution Requirements

This documentation assumes the following resources are ready for use:

* [Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-bot-service)

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## Documentation Note

I used to spend a lot of time explaining code blocks, but will skip that part of my sharing process in favor of a recommendation to copy code blocks to Bing Copilot along with prompts like "what does this do?" or "how does this work" for amazing description and detail!

### Step 7: Confirm Success

Click "Debug" >> "Start Debugging" in the menu bar.

Enter a prompt and press the Enter key on your keyboard... allow time for processing and monitor progress in the messages logged at the bottom of the interface.

When processing is complete, you can expect to see responses from AI Search and OpenAI (both keyword, full, and semantic configurations).
