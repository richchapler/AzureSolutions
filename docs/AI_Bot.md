## Use Case
* "We want to surface our OpenAI solution as a bot in various channels (Teams, Alexa, Facebook, etc.)

## Solution Requirements

This documentation assumes the following resources are ready for use:

* [Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-bot-service)

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## Documentation Note

I used to spend a lot of time explaining code blocks, but will skip that part of my sharing process in favor of a recommendation to copy code blocks to Bing Copilot along with prompts like "what does this do?" or "how does this work" for amazing description and detail!
