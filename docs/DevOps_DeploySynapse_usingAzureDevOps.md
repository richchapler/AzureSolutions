## Exercise 1: Starter Pipeline
In this exercise, we will prepare a DevOps Pipeline that will: 1) archive the existing QA branch, 2) create a new QA branch copied from the PROD branch, and 3) complete a pull request from the DEV branch.

### Step 1: Link Subscription

#### "azureSubscription"

Navigate to Azure DevOps >> Project >> Project Settings >> Pipelines >> Service Connections.

On the "New service connection" pop-out, select "Azure Resource Manager" and then click "Next".









Copy the name of the Service Connection to your Azure Subscription.

Click "Edit" and on the resulting screen, paste the following YAML:

```
pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- script: az config set extension.use_dynamic_install=yes_without_prompt
  displayName: 'Allow Extensions'
- script: echo $(System.AccessToken) | az devops login

      $p = "rchaplerdp"
      $r = "rchaplerdr"
      $b = "QA"
      $dt = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMddHHmmss"
      $branches = az repos ref list --org $o -p $p -r $r --filter "heads/" | ConvertFrom-Json
      $oid = $branches | Where-Object {$_.name -eq "refs/heads/$b"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty objectId
      az repos ref create --name "refs/heads/$b-$dt" --object-id $oid --project $p --repository $r --organization $o
```
variables:
- group: 'rchaplerdvg'
azureSubscription: $(azureSubscription)
az upgrade
az extension add -n azure-devops
az extension update -n azure-devops
      
      ERROR: TF401027: You need the Git 'CreateBranch' permission to perform this action. Details: identity 'Build\af617e9d-b167-4635-9ddc-21574b369387', scope 'repository'.

### Need to grant these permissions... Build\af617e9d-b167-4635-9ddc-21574b369387, Git 'CreateBranch' permission

Logic Explained:
LOREM IPSUM
* `variables` define variables that can be used throughout the pipeline (in this case, the variable group created in Exercise 1)
* `pool...` specifies use of a virtual machine with the latest version of Windows
* `steps` contains pipeline tasks (in this case, just one)
  * `task: AzureCLI@2` runs commands using version 2 of the Azure CLI
    * `inputs` specifies the inputs for the Azure CLI task:
      * `azureSubscription: $(azureSubscription)` specifies the Azure subscription to use (using the previously-set variable)
      * `scriptType: 'pscore'` indicates a PowerShell Core script
      * `scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'` indicates that the script to be executed is written directly in the YAML file
      * `inlineScript` is the actual script, which does the following:
        * Sets variables for the organization URL (`$o`), project (`$p`), repository (`$r`), branch (`$b`), and current datetime (`$dt`)
        * Retrieves the object ID of the specified branch in the repository with the `az repos ref show` command
        * Creates a new branch with the same object ID as the original branch using the `az repos ref create` command
          * The new branch's name is the original branch's name appended with the current datetime

Click "Save".

This pipeline is useful for creating a new branch from an existing one in an Azure DevOps repository. The new branch will have the same commit history as the original branch. The branch name includes a timestamp, which can be useful for keeping track of when the branch was created.

## Reference

* [Use personal access tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate)

To create, list, and manage branches in Azure DevOps using a Personal Access Token (PAT), the token needs to have the appropriate permissionsÂ¹. Here are the permissions you might need:

1. **Code (Read & Write)**: This permission allows you to read and write to the code, which includes creating and deleting branchesÂ¹.

2. **Code (Manage)**: This permission allows you to manage code repositories, which includes managing branchesÂ¹.

When creating a PAT, you can select the scopes for the token to authorize for your specific tasksÂ¹. For example, to create a token to enable a build and release agent to authenticate to Azure DevOps Services, limit your token's scope to Agent Pools (Read & manage)Â¹.

Please note that you should treat and use a PAT like your password and keep it a secretÂ¹.

I hope this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
