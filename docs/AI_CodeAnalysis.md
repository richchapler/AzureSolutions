## Use Case
* "We want to use AI to better understand legacy code"
* "We want to use AI to suggest code optimizations, at scale"

## Solution Requirements

This documentation assumes the following resources are ready for use:

* [AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/search) index with default Semantic Configuration
* Lorem

## Documentation Note

Codeblock explanation is limited... I recommend that you copy code blocks to Bing Copilot along with prompts like "what does this do?" or "how does this work" for amazing description and detail!
