## Use Case
This documentation considers the following requirements and goals:
* "Alation is our enterprise data catalog"
* "We use Azure resources (like Data Explorer) to which Alation cannot connect"
* "We want to get Azure resource metadata into Alation without manual effort"

## Proposed Solution
* Use Purview to gather metadata about our Azure Data Explorer
* Use Logic App to bridge the data into Alation for a consolidated view of all data assets

* [**Logic App**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/)
