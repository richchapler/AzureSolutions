<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/227210296-1540091a-e156-41d9-9cfd-278246c311f1.png" width="1000" />

## Use Case
This solution considers the following requirements:

* "I want to learn about Azure OpenAI with a simple use case"
* "I want to enrich data with compelling content ready for consumption by end-users"

## Required Infrastructure
This solution requires the following resources:

* [**Data Explorer**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/) [Cluster and Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/create-cluster-database-portal)
* [**OpenAI**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview)
* [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/product/workspaces/) with a workspace and collection

## Proposed Solution
This solution will address requirements in three exercises:

* Exercise 1: Test API
* Exercise 2: Data Flow

-----

## Exercise 1: Test API
In this exercise, we will use Postman to test the OpenAI API request.

Navigate to your Postman workspace and collection {e.g., https://web.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}
